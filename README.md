# HydRC4nics

Smart autonmous hydroponic gardening system in collaboration with NUS Residential College 4, RC4SPACE & RC4Earth.

## Motivation

Singapore aims to produce 30% of its nutritional needs by 2030. Land productivity, water, and energy efficiency are believed to be the solution to Singapore's **food security issue**. High technology farms, vertical farming, and hydroponics are some of the solutions that people have produced to tackle the problem.

**Hydroponics** offers the opportunity to teach us about sustainable agriculture and systems thinking; and allows **optimised plant growth** through greater time, resource, and space efficiency.

## Aim

We hope to construct a vertical hydroponic garden equipped with a smart IoT monitoring and control system. The smart embedded monitoring and control system consists of a microcontroller sensor array along with a microcomputer-based application deployed on the web.

The physical structure and electronics will be developed and built separately as part of a Residential College 4 initiative. In this project, we wish to develop the backend and interface for us to monitor and control the system.

## User Stories

1. As an operator who wants to monitor the lights, water levels and nutrient levels in the system, I want to be able to access the information remotely and conveniently.

2. As an operator who wants to control the system, I want to be able to control the system remotely through an easy to use interface.

3. As an interested individual who is curious about the system, I want to be able to view information and data on the system remotely and submit suggestions quickly and conveniently.

4. As an administrator who wants to prevent abuse of the system, I want to be able to identify abusers, warn them, and ban them if they continue to cause problems.
